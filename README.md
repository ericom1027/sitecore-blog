# XM Cloud Starter Kit (Next JS)

## DO THIS FIRST!!
1. Find the `xmcloud.build.json` file in the root folder. Open it and look for the `xmcloudpreview` section. Change the `"name"` values there to your project name (don't use the default sxastarter), using only lowercase letters, hyphens, or underscores (no spaces).

## QUICK START

1. In an ADMIN terminal:

    ```ps1
    .\init.ps1 -InitEnv -LicenseXmlPath "C:\path\to\license.xml" -AdminPassword "DesiredAdminPassword"
    ```

2. Restart your terminal and run:

    ```ps1
    .\up.ps1
    ```

3. Follow the instructions to [deploy to XM Cloud](#deploy-to-xmcloud)

4. Create Edge token and [query from edge](#query-edge)
